                <p>This project was designed to familiarize the developer (that's me!) with ASP.NET MVC projects. The relational database was created using the CodeFirst method and then incorporated into the standard Model-View-Controller pattern.  User authentication and security was set up with the help of the Entity Framework. C# provides behind-the-scenes functionality to support a front-end designed through HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery.</p>
